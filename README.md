# Intelligent-Identification-Toolkit

Intelligent Identification Toolkit is a QR Code Scanner that displays data to a scanned stable URI of non-information resource objects. It basically connects non-information objects like 3D printed products with (meta) information. It follows the rules of the Semantic Web (by Tim Berners Lee). Products can be enhanced with QR Code to link them to information. Not yet existing products e.g. 3D printable products can inhert an QR Code on their surface and can be linked to meta information.
